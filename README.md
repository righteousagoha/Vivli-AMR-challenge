**Overview / Abstract**
This project performs a multidimensional analysis of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) across North and Central America by combining phenotypic surveillance (ATLAS) with targeted genomic investigations (plasmid mobility, GC content, and phylogenomics). The focus species include Acinetobacter baumannii and other high-priority pathogens. Analyses are stratified by country, antibiotic, year, age group, and clinical source to expose regional disparities, demographic risk groups, and genomic signals of horizontal gene transfer. The work supports country-tailored stewardship, One Health surveillance expansion, and demonstrates how integrating phenotypic and genomic data improves AMR intelligence.

Note: Source surveillance data used in these analyses (ATLAS) were obtained via controlled access (Vivli). Some raw industry surveillance datasets cannot be publicly shared due to data access agreements in place. Representative outputs and example processed files are included where permitted.


**Data sources**
ATLAS (Pfizer): primary phenotypic surveillance dataset used (clinical isolates tested 2000–2021). Data were accessed under Vivli data access agreements.
NCBI: representative genomic sequences used for plasmid and phylogenomic analyses (public accession IDs used in analyses).

Data availability: raw ATLAS data are restricted by the data provider — please request access from Vivli (https://amr.vivli.org
) if you wish to reproduce the raw data steps. Example outputs and processed CSV summaries generated by the analysis are included where permitted (see data/).
